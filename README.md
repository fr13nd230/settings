# 🎉 Welcome to the Ultimate Config Repository! 🎉

Hello there, brave code explorer!  

You've just stumbled upon the mystical land where **VSCode** and **Zed** configurations live in harmony. This repo is my personal stash of tweaks, settings, snippets, themes, and probably some questionable experiments that somehow make coding *slightly more magical*.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

- **VSCode configs** – Because why settle for default when you can have glorious custom keybindings, themes, and extensions?
- **Zed configs** – For those who prefer their editor slightly more… zen.
- **Random tweaks** – Stuff I might have forgotten what it does, but hey, it works (mostly).

## 😎 How to Use

1. Clone this repo.
2. Copy the configs to the appropriate places.
3. Marvel at your newfound productivity (or just enjoy the aesthetics, that works too).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

May cause:
- Spontaneous bouts of happiness while coding.
- Confusion if you try to explain why your editor looks cooler than anyone else’s.
- Occasional mild existential crisis when your editor is prettier than your code.

## 🥳 Enjoy!

Feel free to explore, copy, tweak, or just stare in awe. Coding is fun, editors are cooler, and you—yes, you—are awesome for being here.

Happy coding! 🚀
